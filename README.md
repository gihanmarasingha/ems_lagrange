# EMS Curriculum X, 2024

In this project, you will investigate Lagrange's theorem.

Given a group $G$ and a subgroup $H$ of $G$, your task is to show

1. that the left cosets of $H$ form a *partition* of $G$ and
2. that all left cosets of $H$ have the same cardinality (i.e. size).

## Partitions

Let $X$ be a set and let $\mathcal{C}$ be a set of subsets of $X$. For $\mathcal C$
to be a partition of $X$ means that:

1. The set $X$ is the union of all elements of $\mathcal C$. That is, $X = \cup_{A \in \mathcal{C}} A$.
2. Distinct elements of $\mathcal C$ have no element in common. That is, if $A, B \in \mathcal C$, then $A = B$ or $A \cap B = \emptyset$.

## Cardinality

For two sets $A$ and $B$ to have the same cardinality means that there is a bijection $f : A \to B$.
